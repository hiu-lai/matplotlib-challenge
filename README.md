##Unit 5 Homework - Conclusion
1. Out of the 10 drug regimens in the study, mice recovers the best with Ramicane and Capomulins. This can be seen in our boxplot where the quartile and interquartile range relative low, this calculation is further supported by our line graph comparing mice with the smallest tumor volume at timepoint 45 against each drugs.

2. Propriva appears to be the worst drug out of the 10 tested, with the least mice surviving to timepoint 45.

3. The linear regression equation of
       i.   Average Tumor Volume (mm3) = 0.89 x (Mouse Weight (g)) + 22.76   
       ii.  r-squared of 0.9035    
   suggest a close to perfect linear relationship between Tumor volume and Mouse Weight.
