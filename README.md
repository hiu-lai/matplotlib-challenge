##Unit 5 Homework - Conclusion
1. Out of the 10 drug regimens in the study, mice recovers the best with Ramicane and Capomulins. This can be seen in our boxplot where the quartile and interquartile range relative low, this calculation is further supported by our line graph comparing mice with the smallest tumor volume at timepoint 45 against each drugs.

2. Propriva appears to be the worst drug out of the 10 tested, with the least mice surviving to timepoint 45.

3. Correlation coefficient and linear regression model for mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen are;

i.   Average Tumor Volume (mm3) = 0.95 x (Mouse Weight (g)) + 21.55   
ii.  r-squared of 0.7089    
r-squared at 0.7089 suggest moderate effective linear regression model.
